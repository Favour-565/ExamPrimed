(iii) Cancel your Prize.
By registering an Account and/or using any Services or the Website, you hereby agree that we shall be entitled to conduct all such identification, credit and other verification checks from time to time that we may require or deem necessary and/or are required by applicable laws and regulations, and/or by the relevant regulatory authority. You agree to provide all such information as we require in connection with such verification checks. Martad shall be entitled to suspend or restrict your Account and/or any of the Services or part thereof in any manner that we may deem to be appropriate until the relevant checks are completed to our satisfaction. Without limiting the foregoing, in the event, we cannot successfully verify any of the elements of the Account registered details or if any information provided is deemed to be false or inaccurate, Martad reserves the right to void any of the Plays, Suspend or Terminate your Account and forfeit your Prizes. Martad reserves the right to engage a third party to perform verification checks. Any information you provide to Martad for Account registration or send to Martad as part of the Account Management or verification procedures shall be used by the Privacy Policy.
 It is your responsibility to ensure that all details you provide us in satisfaction with our verification checks are kept up to date.

Every User may open only one Account per any of our Games. If we have reasonable grounds to believe that you have more than one Account Per Game (including any Accounts you opened with misspellings or different variations of your name or email) and we reasonably believe that multiple Accounts have been opened or used in breach of the Terms of Use, we may close your Accounts, or allow you to retain the first Account you opened with us.

An Account terminated by you may be reopened depending on the circumstances and the reasons for Account termination, on your request and at Martad’s discretion, subject to successful identity verification checks. In such event, the use of the Website(s) and/or the Services shall be subject to the Terms of Use that are in force at the date of Account reactivation. You will not be able to register a new account with Martad once your Account has been closed.

As a result of the review or investigation, the Account and/or any specific suspended functionality will be either re-activated or terminated. If any potentially suspicious activity is performed under your Account, you may be requested to provide us with additional documentation confirming your identity or source of funds or address.
